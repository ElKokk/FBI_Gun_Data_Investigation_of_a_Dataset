Our Data

The data comes from the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System. The NICS is used by to determine whether a prospective buyer is eligible to buy firearms or explosives. Gun shops call into this system to ensure that each customer does not have a criminal record or isn’t otherwise ineligible to make a purchase. The data has been supplemented with state level datafrom census.gov.● The NICS data is found in one
sheet of an .xlsx file. It contains
the number of firearm checks by
month, state, and type.
● The U.S. census data is found
in a .csv file. It contains several
variables at the state level. Most
variables just have one data
point per state (2016), but a few
have data for more than one
year.
